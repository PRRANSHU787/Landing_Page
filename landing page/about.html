                        <p class=" text-center">There are many benefits to increasing one’s general fitness level, such as a reduction in stress,[1] to feel better, a decreased likelihood of contracting many cardiovascular diseases, etc. Implementing or emphasizing an increased consistent level of physical activity is a surefire way to increase general fitness levels. The amount that one must be active and in doing what varies from person to person; for example, LeBron James has a much different training regimen than Judge Judy.
                            There are also many ways to decrease one’s general fitness level. Injury, stress, tragedy, all of these can cause one to become less active and decreasing your body’s BMR. A general reduction in physical activity will also absolutely cause a decrease in general fitness</p>

                <p class="my-2">Windy City Strength & Conditioning is a dedicated, full time Strength and Conditioning facility. We use kettlebells, barbells, dumbbells, bumper plates, jump boxes, medicine balls, rowers, gymnastics rings, parallettes and pull-up bars to effectively train our athletes every day.</p>
                <p class="my-2">One workout guaranteed to get your heart and good vibes pumping is cardio. After all, cardiovascular exercise, or cardio for short, is moving your body with the purpose of increasing your heart rate, Megan Clare, CPT, says. “Not only will you break a sweat and get your blood flowing, but you will also feel all the good feels from it," she adds.

                    That doesn't mean you need to hop on the treadmill. If you don't love running, don’t sweat it (see what I did there?). There are tons of different effective cardio exercises. Beyond the elliptical, stationary bike, or treadmill, there’s also high-intensity interval training (HIIT), hiking, swimming, and rowing. Plus, some strength training moves will get you out of breath, serving as a bonus cardio exercise.</p>
